Running and testing the project:

1) Download the project source code from https://github.com/arunkumar413/Online-EDA.git
2) Unzip/extract the the contents of the dowloaded zip file.
3) cd to the project directory containing the files: home.html,parts.js.editor.js etc,.
4) If you're using python 3.x version on your machine execute this code:
   python -m http.server
5) If Python version returned above is 2.X run:
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer
6)Visit http://localhost:8000/home.html to access the application.
7) By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. 
8) For more info on running a simple http server vist https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server


Note:  If you already have something running on port 8000, you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, e.g. python -m http.server 7800 (Python 3.x) or python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800 (Python 2.x). 
You can then access your content at localhost:7800.
